// OGX is the subscription plan sold by OG Lab. Inference runs through OG Lab's
// gateway, which speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions API, so the provider is an
// ordinary *OpenAIProvider pointed at the gateway with the token the connect
// flow stored — no protocol of its own.
//
// Two things make it different from every other OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
//
//   - The gateway's /v1/models IS the plan. It returns exactly the models the
//     account's plan grants, and an empty list when the plan grants none. So
//     Models() has no static fallback: a catalogue that comes back empty means
//     the plan carries nothing, and offering a fallback would present models
//     the account cannot reach.
//   - The token is durable and per-install, and the gateway reads the
//     prompt_cache_key field as the session identity for token spend, so every
//     request carries it.
//
// Registration is gated on the stored link carrying a plan (session.OGXAccount
// .HasPlan). A planless link contributes no provider at all, which is what keeps
// it from becoming the default. One residual case is left unguarded: a plan
// whose catalogue fetches empty registers a provider that can serve nothing, and
// ProviderPriority would place it ahead of every other provider. That only
// happens for a plan with no granted models, which the settings screen surfaces
// as an empty, explained list rather than a failure.

// OGXAppID is the first-party identity ogcode presents to the gateway when it
// asserts its requests. It matches the `app` the connect flow registers with,
// and it is the key the gateway's app-secret table looks the shared secret up
// under.

// against. OGX_GATEWAY_URL overrides it — development and staging point this at
// a local gateway.

// OGXAppSecret is the shared secret ogcode signs its gateway requests with, so
// the gateway admits this first-party client and not a bearer token copied out
// of it. It is baked in at build time via ldflags (see the Makefile) and reads
// from the OGX_APP_SECRET environment variable there, so a release binary
// carries the identity while a local build leaves it empty and unasserted.

// left empty on purpose: unlike the other OpenAI-compatible providers there is
// no useful guess to make, because the gateway is the only thing that knows
// what the plan grants — Models() resolves a default from the fetched
// catalogue. The collection is empty too, so the UI groups the models under the
// provider id ("ogx") rather than inventing a label.

// nothing" (0, nil) apart from "the gateway could not be asked" (an error),
// because the settings screen acts on the first and must not on the second.

// A 401 is the token's fault only when the gateway says so: it also answers
