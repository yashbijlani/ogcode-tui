	// A ULID is a 48-bit millisecond timestamp followed by 80 bits of entropy,
	// and it sorts by time only because the timestamp is the high-order half.
	// Inside one millisecond the timestamps are equal and the entropy decides
	// the order — so drawing fresh randomness each time makes that order a coin
	// flip. Measured on this generator before the fix: of 5000 ids produced in a
	// loop, 4998 consecutive pairs shared a millisecond and 50.5% of them sorted
	// backwards.
	//
	// That matters because ids are the sort key. Messages come back from the
	// store ordered by id, and an assistant turn and the tool-result written
	// straight after it are routinely sub-millisecond apart — no network round
	// trip separates them, just two inserts. Half the time the reply sorted
	// before the thing it replied to, which any code reading order as causality
	// gets wrong.
	//
	// Monotonic increments the previous entropy instead, so equal timestamps
	// break ties in creation order.

	// mu guards entropy. Neither *rand.Rand nor *ulid.MonotonicEntropy is safe
	// for concurrent use, and the monotonic reader is stateful in a way the
	// plain source was not — it carries the previous id forward — so the lock
	// is load-bearing rather than defensive.
