; Outline queries for TypeScript and TSX.
;
; Shared by both grammars: TSX is TypeScript plus JSX, and nothing captured here
; is JSX-specific, so one query file compiles against both languages.
;
; Every top-level form appears twice — bare, and wrapped in `export_statement`.
; `export function f() {}` parses as (export_statement (function_declaration)),
; so a pattern anchored only under (program) would match the export wrapper and
; miss the declaration inside it. Most declarations in a TypeScript codebase are
; exported, so omitting the second form would lose most of the file.
;
; The wrapped patterns capture the inner declaration, not the export_statement.
; The two start on the same line, so line ranges are unaffected, and docStart
; climbs to the outermost ancestor on that line to find a doc comment attached
; to the `export` (see docAnchor).

; --- top level -------------------------------------------------------------
(program (function_declaration) @def.func)
(program (generator_function_declaration) @def.func)
(program (class_declaration) @def.class)
(program (abstract_class_declaration) @def.class)
(program (interface_declaration) @def.interface)
(program (type_alias_declaration) @def.type)
(program (enum_declaration) @def.enum)
(program (lexical_declaration) @def.const)
(program (variable_declaration) @def.var)
(program (internal_module) @def.namespace)
(program (import_statement) @def.import)

; --- the same, exported ----------------------------------------------------
(program (export_statement (function_declaration) @def.func))
(program (export_statement (generator_function_declaration) @def.func))
(program (export_statement (class_declaration) @def.class))
(program (export_statement (abstract_class_declaration) @def.class))
(program (export_statement (interface_declaration) @def.interface))
(program (export_statement (type_alias_declaration) @def.type))
(program (export_statement (enum_declaration) @def.enum))
(program (export_statement (lexical_declaration) @def.const))
(program (export_statement (variable_declaration) @def.var))
(program (export_statement (internal_module) @def.namespace))

; --- class members ---------------------------------------------------------
; Methods are where a class's code actually lives, so they earn a line each.
; Field definitions do not: a class with twenty one-line properties would bury
; its methods, and the class's own range already covers them.
(class_body (method_definition) @def.method)

; --- functions nested inside functions --------------------------------------
; A SolidJS or React component is one top-level arrow function holding the whole
; module: mapping it to a single 900-line range tells a reader nothing they did
; not already know. These patterns reach inside it for the handlers and helpers
; that make up its structure.
;
; Only function-valued declarations qualify. A bare `const n = 1` is a local, and
; listing locals is the noise that makes an outline worthless — the same reason
; the Go queries anchor under (source_file).
(statement_block (function_declaration) @def.func)
(statement_block (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator value: (arrow_function))) @def.func)
(statement_block (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator value: (function_expression))) @def.func)

; --- anonymous default exports -----------------------------------------------
; `export default function () {}`, `export default () => {}` and
; `export default {…}` declare nothing a pattern above can bind: the value sits
; in the export's `value` field, where the named forms use `declaration`. They
; are captured whole, as the export itself — without it such a module mapped to
; nothing but its imports, and the handlers inside a default-exported component
; surfaced at file scope with nothing to show they belonged to it.
(program (export_statement value: (_)) @def.default)

; --- object-literal modules --------------------------------------------------
; `export const api = { get() {…}, post: async () => {…} }` is a module of
; functions written as one object, and `export default {…}` is the same shape
; for Vue's options API. Their function-valued members are where the code
; lives, so they earn a line each, as a class's methods do. Only function
; values qualify: a plain property is data, and the object's range covers it.
(program (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator value: (object (method_definition) @def.method))))
(program (export_statement (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator value: (object (method_definition) @def.method)))))
(program (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator value: (object (pair value: [(arrow_function) (function_expression)]) @def.method))))
(program (export_statement (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator value: (object (pair value: [(arrow_function) (function_expression)]) @def.method)))))
(program (export_statement value: (object (method_definition) @def.method)))
(program (export_statement value: (object (pair value: [(arrow_function) (function_expression)]) @def.method)))
