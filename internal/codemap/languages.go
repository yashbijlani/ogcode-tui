// pattern automaton, which is far more expensive than the parse it serves; a
// *ts.Query is only mutated by DisableCapture/DisablePattern, which this
// package never calls, so sharing one across goroutines is safe. The mutable
// half of matching lives in the per-call *ts.QueryCursor.

// registry maps lowercased file extension to its language.
//
// Adding a language is an entry here plus a queries/<lang>.scm; everything
// downstream — doc-comment attachment, name extraction, signature rendering,
// the tool itself — is grammar-agnostic. Each grammar compiles its parser.c
// into the binary for all six release targets, so they earn their way in one at
// a time rather than arriving as a bundle.
//
// TypeScript ships two parsers in one module and both are registered: TSX
// cannot parse the `<T>expr` type assertion (it reads as JSX), and TypeScript
// cannot parse JSX at all, so neither covers the other's files.
//
// Plain JavaScript is routed to the TSX parser rather than pulling in a third
// grammar. TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript and TSX adds JSX on
// top, so every .js and .jsx file is valid input — and .js files carrying JSX,
// which a bare TypeScript parser would reject, parse correctly.
//
// PHP likewise ships two parsers, and here only one is registered: `php` reads
// a file as text that opens into code at `<?php`, which is what a file on disk
// is, while `php_only` expects a bare fragment with no tags. Templates (.phtml)
// return to HTML between blocks, and `php` handles that in the same parser.
//
// Python is the first entry to need more than a grammar and a query: it hangs
// decorators above the declaration they modify and its doc lives inside the
// body, so it sets wrapperKind and docstrings as well.
//
// Rust needs the third such accommodation. It splits comments into two node
// kinds, marks a doc comment with a third slash, and puts attributes between
// the doc comment and the item — as siblings rather than as a wrapper.
//
// Swift needs none of them. It splits comments in two the way Rust does, but
// parses its attributes into a (modifiers) node inside the declaration, so the
// range and the signature cover them without help. Its grammar is the one
// entry that is vendored rather than required — see grammars/swift.
//
// Java is the same shape as Swift and needs nothing beyond the two comment
// kinds: its annotations also live in a (modifiers) node inside the
// declaration.
//
// HTML captures by attribute rather than by declaration kind: an element is
// worth an outline line only when it carries an id or a class, the two
// attributes authors put on a region worth jumping to. script and style
// elements are captured unconditionally, since their bodies parse as a
// raw_text leaf that no other query can see into. Names come from the id, the
// class, or the tag, in that order — markup names itself by role, not by
// syntax.
//
// CSS names a rule by the selectors text itself: there is nothing else to
// name it by, and a collapsed selector line is exactly what a reader scans a
// stylesheet for. Its patterns stay unanchored because rules nest inside the
// blocks of other rules — anchoring under the stylesheet would hide a media
// query's rules, the bulk of most real stylesheets.
