Each line comes back as its line number, a '|', then the line exactly as it is in the file — so everything after the FIRST '|' is literal content, including its leading tabs or spaces, and that is what an edit anchor must copy. To read one region of a file, pass start_line/end_line — 1-based, inclusive, and taking the ranges printed by file_map directly. IMPORTANT: reading a file longer than 200 lines without a range returns that file's map instead of its contents, so map first and read the range you need. If you truly need an entire long file, say so explicitly with start_line=1 and end_line set past its length. Use offset/limit to page through a file once you know its shape — a limit on its own is honoured only up to 200 lines, because it says how much to read but not which part."
