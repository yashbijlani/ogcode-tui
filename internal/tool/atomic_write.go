// bits plus setuid/setgid/sticky. Mode().Perm() alone masks the special bits

// touched the inode's mode at all.

// writeFileAtomic replaces the contents of path with data. It either fully
// succeeds or leaves the file exactly as it was.
//
// os.WriteFile opens with O_TRUNC, so it empties the file before the new bytes
// land. A failure partway through — a full disk, an I/O error, a quota — left a
// truncated file with the previous contents gone and no way back; the edit tool
// even held the entire original in memory and still could not put it back.
// Writing a temporary file in the same directory and renaming it over the
// target moves the only destructive step to rename(2), which is atomic: a
// concurrent reader sees either the whole old file or the whole new one, and
// any failure before the rename leaves the original untouched.
//
// Two properties of the in-place write are preserved deliberately:
//
//   - The file's mode, special bits included. Rename replaces the inode, so a
//     fresh temp file's permissions would silently become the file's —
//     stripping the executable bit off every script the agent edits, and the
//     setuid/setgid/sticky bits off the rare file that carries them. The
//     existing mode is read first and applied to the temp file.
//
//   - Symlinks are followed, not replaced. Writing through a link updated its
//     target and left the link a link; renaming over the link itself would
//     instead replace it with a regular file, quietly breaking a repo that
//     symlinks a file into place. The link is resolved first so the rename
//     lands on the real file.
//
// Not preserved, both inherent to the temp-and-rename pattern every editor
// uses, and both far cheaper than the truncation this replaces: hard links to
// the target are broken by the rename, and the file ends up owned by this
// process.
//
// The data is deliberately not fsynced before the rename. What this fixes is a
// write that fails partway, which rename handles completely on its own;
// surviving a power cut on top of that would cost an F_FULLFSYNC per file on
// macOS, which is far too much to spend on every edit an agent makes.
