// AskUserTool puts a small batch of questions to the user and waits for the
// answers. It is the channel for whatever only the user can tell the agent — a
// preference, a constraint, a choice with real trade-offs, or a step of
// something they are meant to play along with (a quiz, a survey, a
// walk-through). What the agent can find out for itself — from the code, a
// file, the web, a command — does not belong here. The batch is rendered as
// paginated screens in one dialog; the answers come back as the tool result and
// the turn continues. It is a blocking round trip — the turn pauses until the
// user answers (or the run is cancelled).
//
// A screen can depend on an earlier answer: give a question an id and gate the
// next one on it with showWhen, so the user only ever sees the branch that
// applies to them. The result reports both the answers given and which screens
// were skipped, so the model can see the path the user took.
//
// It is only offered to an interactive session: the tool is registered where a
// question manager exists and the loop only offers it under permission gating
// (see LoopRunner.RunLoop). Headless runs and sub-agents never see it.
