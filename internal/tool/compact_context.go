// the earlier steps of the turn in exchange for a summary the agent writes. It is
// offered to every read-capable agent on every provider. Shedding finished work
// keeps the model's reasoning focused on what the task still needs and stops that
// work being re-sent every step; the token saving is largest where the endpoint
// does not cache a repeated prefix, but the focus it buys helps a long turn
// anywhere.
//
// The tool itself only validates. The agent loop does the work: seeing this
// call, it records a watermark at the assistant message that made it, and from
// the next step onward assembles the request as the summary plus everything
// after that watermark. Nothing is deleted — the session store keeps every
// message, so history and the UI are unaffected — only the model-facing slice
// narrows.

Your summary becomes the only record of that work for the rest of the turn, so it must carry every conclusion, file path, and decision you still need, and — if you asked the user anything with ask_user — each question with the answer it got, verbatim. Anything you leave out is gone and must be rediscovered from scratch."
