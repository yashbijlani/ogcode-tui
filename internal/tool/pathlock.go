// fileLocks serializes the built-in mutating file tools (write, edit) that
// target the same file. The agent loop executes a turn's tool calls
// concurrently (goroutines + WaitGroup); without this, two write/edit calls
// aimed at the same file would race — a lost update, or edit reading a
// half-written file. Reads are intentionally NOT gated here: a torn read is
// recoverable (the model re-reads), whereas a lost write is silent data loss.
// The order between calls on one file is the agent loop's job, not this lock's:
// it runs a batch's calls on the same file in the order the model wrote them
// (see agent.sameFileWaits, keyed by FileKey), so a read written after an edit
// sees the edit. bash is not covered either — a shell command can touch any
// path, so there is nothing to key its writes on; a bash mutation racing an
// edit in the same turn remains the caller's hazard.
//
// The map grows by one entry per distinct file touched in the process lifetime,
// which is bounded by the number of files a session edits — acceptable, and far
// cheaper than the alternative races.

// while not folding on a case-insensitive one hands two spellings of a single
// file different locks — exactly the race this map exists to prevent.

// package that need to know whether two tool calls touch the same file: path
// resolved against dir the way the tools resolve a relative path, then keyed
// exactly as lockPath keys it — so "a.go", "./a.go", its absolute spelling and
// a symlink to it all agree.

// absolute and cleaned (so "a/b.go", "./a/b.go" and "/abs/a/b.go" agree), with
// symlinks resolved and, on case-insensitive platforms, case folded.
//
// The symlink resolution matters because the write path itself resolves links
// before renaming (see writeFileAtomic): a link and its target are one file to
// the write, so they must be one file here too, or an edit via the link races
// an edit via the target on different locks. The final component is resolved
// the same way the write will resolve it (resolveWriteTarget, dangling links
// included); parent directories go through EvalSymlinks, which needs them to
// exist — as any write into them does. ToLower is an approximation of the
// filesystem's own folding (APFS folds full Unicode), sufficient for the
// spellings that actually occur.
