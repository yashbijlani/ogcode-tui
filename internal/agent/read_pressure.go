// Read pressure is the volume of file, search, and page content the agent has
// pulled into the current turn. All of it stays in the context: it crowds the
// model's reasoning and is re-sent on every remaining step. A long reading phase
// is thus both a drag on accuracy and, where the endpoint does not cache a
// repeated prefix, the most expensive thing the agent does — and the one it is
// least likely to notice, because each individual read looks cheap.
//
// compact_context exists to reclaim exactly that space, but the agent has to
// remember to reach for it. This tracker watches the reading as it happens and,
// once it has crossed a threshold over several steps, attaches a reminder to the
// NEXT content-returning tool result — the moment the agent is demonstrably
// still in a reading phase and the directive can still change what it does. The
// reminder is not advice: it keeps arriving until the agent compacts, because the
// turn that ignores it once is exactly the turn it exists for.
//
// Volume is only half the picture. Every step sends the whole context back to the
// model, so a turn that reads little but runs long still pays for all of its
// finished work on every remaining step — and on an endpoint that does not cache
// a repeated prefix, that re-send is the bill. So a second trigger watches the
// accumulated cost of re-sending (the sum of the context size across the steps so
// far) and arms the same reminder once it crosses a multiple of the model's
// window. The two triggers are independent: whichever crosses its own threshold
// first arms the reminder, and each re-arms on its own pacing, so one turn can be
// reminded for crowding, for cost, or for both, at different steps.
