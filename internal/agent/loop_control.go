// and optionally cancel the currently-running tool call without killing the
// whole loop.
//
// The guidance is ephemeral: it is never persisted to the database message
// history. Instead it is appended to the user's turn message content on the
// next LLM call — the model sees it as additional user input, not as a system
// directive. This avoids interactions with compaction boundaries,
// findLastTextUserMessageIndex turn-slicing, and agentic-memory
// <prior_context> filtering — all of which key off persisted user messages.
