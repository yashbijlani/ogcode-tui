// projectIndexPrompt returns the mandatory project index instructions section,
// scoped to the given agent role. The workflow tail is tailored to whether the
// agent can make changes (build) or is read-only (plan, note). Agents that have
// the codebase_map tool must use it before any file exploration.
//
// The codebase_map paragraph has to teach the descent, not just name the tool.
// The map returns one directory level per call, so an agent told only "call
// codebase_map first" sees a handful of folder names, concludes the index holds
// nothing useful, and falls back to grep — having paid for the call and thrown
// away the labels that were the answer.
//
// It also carries the file_map step. The two tools answer different questions —
// codebase_map which file, file_map where inside it — and file_map deliberately
// does not depend on the index, so it still applies in projects where
// codebase_map comes back empty.
//
// hasBash gates the shell rule. read enforces map-before-read at the tool
// boundary, but bash does not: cat on a long file takes the whole thing in one
// call and neither guard fires. The agents that hold bash are the ones that
// need telling; naming the bypass to an agent without a shell just describes a
// call it will never be offered.
//
// hasDocTools gates the per-page document paragraph for the same reason. The
// index lists PDF and DOCX leaves for every agent, but only some agents can
// open one, and pointing the rest at pdf_index sends them after a call they
// will never be offered. They are told the documents exist and that they
// cannot read them, which is the part that changes what they do next.

**Rule:** When the project has been indexed, you **MUST** call "codebase_map" first — before reading any file or guessing at project structure.

It shows **one directory level per call**. Every folder on that level is a single line: how many files it holds and the subfolders directly inside it, then a sample of topic labels drawn from across the whole folder; files sitting directly on that level are listed with their own labels. Nothing deeper is shown — a folder line is a door, not a listing.

**Navigate by the labels.** Pick the folder whose labels or subfolder names match your task, call "codebase_map" again with "subdir" set to its path from the project root — the folder itself, or straight to one of the subfolders its line names — and repeat until the files you want are listed — usually one to three calls. This is the point of the tool: a folder whose labels have nothing to do with your task is an entire branch you never open. Do not stop at the top level and conclude the index is unhelpful because it only named folders; descending is how you use it.

If it comes back empty, the project has not been indexed: stop calling it this session and use glob and grep instead. Use those too when the index does not cover what you need — unindexed files, binary patterns. codebase_map is your **first** exploration step whenever an index exists, never a blocker on getting the work done.

Task received

  → codebase_map(subdir="<folder>")       ← descend into the folder whose labels match the task
  → codebase_map(subdir="<folder>/<sub>") ← repeat until the files you want are listed
  → file_map(path)                        ← MANDATORY before reading an unfamiliar file: where things are inside it
  → read(path, start_line, end_line)      ← only the region you need
` + workflowEnd + `

## Mandatory: Map a File Before Reading It

**Rule:** Before reading a source file you do not already know, you **MUST** call "file_map" on it, then read only the range you need. Read one in full only when it is short, or when the map shows you genuinely need all of it — every line you pull in is re-sent on every step for the rest of the turn.

This is enforced, not advisory: "read" on a file longer than 200 lines with no range returns that file's map instead of its contents. Demanding the whole file still works — start_line=1 with end_line past its length — but it should be rare and deliberate.

"file_map" returns every declaration with its 1-based line range and doc comment, and those ranges go straight into "read":

  file_map("internal/tool/read.go")
    → 37-159  func (ReadTool) Execute(ctx context.Context, ...) (Result, error)

  read("internal/tool/read.go", start_line=37, end_line=159)

"start_line" and "end_line" are inclusive and use exactly the numbering "file_map" prints, so copy a range across as-is — never convert it to "offset". A range already covers the declaration's doc comment. Indented entries are nested inside the entry above them, so you can jump to one method or handler instead of reading its whole container.

` + remap + `"file_map" itself is never stale — it parses the file on each call and consults no index, so it works in any project, indexed or not.` + shellRule

- Write down only what you have seen hold, and say how you know it when that is not obvious — the command or file that showed it. An inference you have not checked is marked "(unverified)" or left out: later sessions read this file as ground truth.

## Live service preview

A local service you start on a loopback port is reachable through this server at its own hostname — a dev server, a player, a dashboard. The service's port is the first label of the host, and the address also carries the port this server itself listens on:

  http://3000.%s:<server-port>/          ->  http://127.0.0.1:3000/
  http://3000.%s:<server-port>/app.js    ->  http://127.0.0.1:3000/app.js

The two ports are different and both are required: 3000 is what the service listens on, <server-port> is the port in the address you are already using to reach this server. Omit <server-port> only when this server itself listens on 80 or 443 — a URL with no port sends the browser to port 80, where it reaches whatever else is there instead of this server, and the service fails to load. Each service answers at the root of its own origin, so an app that reads its own location or absolute URLs works unchanged. The path after the host is forwarded unchanged (WebSockets and streaming responses included), so return this hostname URL when something is running that the user should open in the browser. Only loopback targets are reachable this way, and the port must be listening before the URL will load.

A port is served at its hostname only once it is published, and writing its live-preview URL in your reply is what publishes it (the user can also add a port on the Preview page). Until then the hostname answers 403, so write the URL as soon as the service is up. To check a service yourself, request http://127.0.0.1:<port>/ directly rather than its preview hostname. This server's own port is never served as a preview.

That is one round trip and cannot half-apply a refactor. Separate same-file "edit" calls in one block remain safe — the runtime serializes mutations to the same path, in the order you wrote them, so each re-reads after the last applied — but they commit independently, and an anchor an earlier one changed fails cleanly — "old_string not found" when it was consumed, or an ambiguity error if its replacement duplicated it — so re-issue that one after seeing the result. **Never batch a "write" with an "edit" to the same file** — the edit would anchor on content the write replaces, which you have not seen.

**The shell is the one thing the runtime cannot order.** It cannot tell which files a "bash" command touches, so a command that changes files — a formatter, a code generator, a "git checkout" — runs alongside everything else in its block. Give such a command a block of its own, and read, edit or check what it changed in the next. Commands that depend on each other — install then test, add then commit — belong in one command joined with "&&", not in parallel calls.

"write" and "edit" already report syntax errors in what they change, so "check_syntax" is only for files changed another way (a shell command, a formatter, a generator) or to confirm a fix.`

Carrying that is not just a token cost; it is an accuracy cost. The more finished detail crowds your context, the more your attention is spread across things that no longer matter, and the easier it is to lose the thread or contradict something you already established.

Either way it fires once this much finished material has already accumulated, and it keeps arriving — it is deliberately never capped — until you call the tool. When you see it, compact now; do not read anything else first. "Disregard this and carry on" is not one of your options. The single exception is the case the reminder cannot see: nothing finished is left in your context, and every item still in front of you is in active use for the immediate next action, so a summary would lose something still needed. If that is not true, compact.

Do not call it on a short turn, or when the material still in context is what you are actively working from. Two or three large reads behind you is the signal; a couple of small ones is not.

**Your summary is the only thing that survives.** Everything before the call leaves your context for the rest of the turn. Write it for someone who cannot see any of that work:

- What the task is, and what still remains to do
- What you established, with exact file paths and line ranges
- Decisions you made, and approaches you ruled out — so you do not retry them
- Exact values you would otherwise have to look up again: names, signatures, flags, commands, config
- What you deliberately left out, if you decided something was irrelevant

**The answers the user gave you must survive verbatim.** If you put questions to the user with "ask_user", the summary must carry each question and the answer it got — the option the user chose, or the text they typed. Those answers steer every step after them, so a summary that drops or generalises them has lost the steering.

Leave out the raw file contents you have already drawn conclusions from — that is the weight you are trying to shed. Keep the conclusions, drop the transcript.

If you find afterwards that the summary is missing something, read it again rather than guessing. That costs one call; guessing costs correctness.`

// askUserPrompt returns the guidance for asking the user a question. It is
// emitted only when the ask_user tool is actually on the wire — a gated,
// interactive session whose loop has a question manager — so an agent reading
// it can always act on it.
//
// The rule is stated positively first: a question you would otherwise put to the
// user in prose belongs in the tool, options and all. The one thing this must
// not license is the tool as a crutch — a question the agent could have answered
// itself from the code, a file or the web costs the user a full round trip for
// nothing — so the "find it out yourself" boundary is stated as the qualifier on
// the rule rather than as a prohibition ahead of it.

	return `## Asking the User

Whatever you need to ask the user, ask it with "ask_user" rather than in prose: it opens the answer dialog, where your options become buttons and one click settles a question. That covers anything the user would otherwise have to type a reply to — a preference or constraint only they know, a choice between approaches with real trade-offs — and equally a back-and-forth the user is meant to play along with: a quiz, a survey, a step-by-step walk-through. Ask each step through the tool, not as prose.

The one limit: **if you can find it out yourself, find it out.** The source code, a file, the web, a command — all of that is yours to read, search and run, and a question there is a round trip spent on something already answered. Ask only what a person's answer is genuinely needed for.

Ask everything you need in **one call**. The batch is shown as a short set of screens in a single dialog, so a second call is a second interruption.

- **Header**: a short title for the screen (2-5 words).
- **Question**: one clear sentence — state what you are asking and why it matters.
- **Options**: 2-4 concrete answers you propose, best first, each with a one-line description. Mark "multiSelect" only when several could apply at once; otherwise it is pick-one.
- **Freeform**: the user can always type an answer of their own, so your options need not be exhaustive — a good set of suggestions is faster to answer than an open field, and never a constraint.

**When one screen depends on an earlier answer, say so in the batch.** Give the earlier question an "id", then set "showWhen" on the later one ({"question": "<id>", "options": ["<label>"]} — add "not": true to show it when none of those labels was picked, or omit "options" to match any answer at all). The dialog evaluates this as the user answers, so they only ever see the branch that applies, and the tool result tells you which screens were shown and which were skipped for not matching. Branch only on an earlier question; do not expect the user to answer a screen whose branch did not apply.

The turn pauses until they answer. A blank answer means the user declined to pick: for a preference that is licence to use your judgement and say what you chose; for a question whose content you actually need — a quiz answer, a fact — they did not answer, so do not invent one.`
