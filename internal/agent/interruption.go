// classifyInterruption turns the error that ended a turn into the record a
// resume decides from.
//
// The question it answers is narrower than "what went wrong": it is "would
// running this again, later, plausibly get further?". A rate limit says yes
// once the window rolls over; a rejected key says yes once a human fixes the
// account; a malformed request says no, because the same request will be
// malformed the next time too. Offering a Resume button on that last case
// would be worse than offering nothing — it invites the user to spend their
// time re-running a failure.
//
// Everything unrecognised is treated as resumable. The cost of a resume that
// fails again is one wasted request; the cost of refusing to resume something
// that would have worked is a session the user cannot get back.
